# This file is for Jenkins cloud agent configurations.
# For Phase 1 (local dev), EC2 configurations will be placeholders.
# Actual values for AMI IDs, credentials, subnets, etc.,
# will be needed for staging and production environments.

  clouds:
    # This section defines a connection to an AWS EC2 cloud.
    # - cloudName: A unique name for this cloud configuration in Jenkins.
    # - region: The AWS region where EC2 instances will be launched.
    # - credentialsId: The ID of a Jenkins credential (e.g., AWS Credentials
    #   type) that provides access to your AWS account. This credential would
    #   typically be defined in 06-credentials.yaml or via another
    #   secure mechanism.
    # - privateKey: (Optional/Alternative to credentialsId for some auth
    #   methods) Raw private key material. Using credentialsId with an IAM role
    #   is often preferred.
    # - instanceCapStr: A string representing the maximum number of instances
    #   this cloud configuration can launch.
    # - sshPort: Port used for SSH connections to agents.

        # Templates define the types of EC2 instances Jenkins can launch.
        # Each template uses attributes like 'ami', 'description', 'type'
        # 'labelString' (for agent labels), 'remoteFS', 'subnetId',
        # 'securityGroups','iamInstanceProfile', and 'tags'.
        # 'keyPairName' was omitted based on JCasC error analysis; ensure your
        # AMI/agent setup does not strictly require it if primarily using IAM
        # profiles for auth.
